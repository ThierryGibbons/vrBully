### Why I want to create this
**I'm just someone that likes showing VR to their friends.**
- 🌿 I'm currently doing nothing with my life.
- 💯 I'm about to start studying again when student life kicks in.
- 🏆 2022 Goals: Contribute in Open Source VR projects.

**Download:**
Downloads will be availiable either here, some future discord server and potentialy on steam

Initialy may have to be a web app considering I don't know anything about launching a phone app or how the beta process works for testing apps on phones.
